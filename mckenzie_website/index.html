            <p class="description"> 
             As you're aware, I am a student at George Mason University, and I also hold the role of an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in the Department of Computer Science.
                 Being an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant is something I genuinely relish because I have a passion for tutoring and aiding fellow students in their educational pursuits.
                  The opportunity to offer assistance to others in their academic journeys is incredibly fulfilling. Witnessing students progress and grasp concepts that once posed challenges to them is truly remarkable. I emphasize this because I have a profound appreciation for the value of facing and conquering challenges, and having the opportunity to support students who were once in my shoes is a deeply gratifying experience.
